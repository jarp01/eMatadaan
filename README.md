Proposal:

This project is based on transforming the voting system for simple elections, i.e. where the number of voters is not too much. But with some improvement in different areas, it can be implemented in larger scale as well. Here we are focusing on addressing the problems which arise due to paper-based voting system and, thus, will be creating a voting system based on C programming language. This project is basically a minor project, which is for the partial fulfillment of the course of study of C programming language.
This project, named ‘eMatadaan.c’, will make use of a wide range of concepts such as conditional statements, loops, arrays, pointers, structures, functions(user-defined), file handling, and so on. There will also be effects such as color changing, password, etc.
Following are some of the other features (or steps-of-use of the software) of our project:   
  1. The organizer gets access to the screen from which he/she can set-up and enter password and manage voters’ and candidates’                information.
  2. They can add details like voters’ name, address, ID, etc. These details can be modified and even exported to text format.   
  3. They can also add the candidates’ information, which can also be modifed and can be exported to text format.   
  4. The voting screen enables registered voters to log in with their ID and password to begin                                                  voting. Now they can vote for their preferred candidate.   
  5. After submission of each vote a new screen will appear, where the next voter can repeat the same process for voting.  
  6. The voting process finishes as soon as all of the registered voters have cast their vote, or it can simply be terminated by the            organizer with a secret key of their own choice!  
  7. The final result will be shown on the screen after the previous step.
  
This project has got multiple benefits. One of the major benefits would be that the voter management and voting both would be quite efficient and enough secure. There will hardly be any chance of misue of resources available. It is also going to make it a portable and easy way of voting. Similarly, it would facilitate the organizers to handle the whole of voting process very efficiently and easily.
